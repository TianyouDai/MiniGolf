# MiniGolf

Bend the rules of what people expect from golf in a surprising and adventurous way
Allow people to “escape” from the course and go on a weird side-adventure. Like have one seemingly broken hole that leads downs rabbit hole
What-the-golf was wacky, but this would be more wow or fascinating or cool. Make a simple version with axis aligned collisions?

# Dev Notes

- [ ] Instead of `getAttribute` in `CreateHole` use `getBoundingClientRect()` because elements will not always have x, y, width, height

- [ ] Make holes winnable

- [ ] Transition between holes on win. Different scenes would be ideal
